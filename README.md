# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
TSP can be illustrated as a salesman who must travel through all the cities designated by the shortest distances, where each city must be visited only once.
Solution of the TSP is the path traversed by this salesman.
Surely the best or optimal solution of this problem is the path with the shortest distance

The Travelling salesman problem is an NP-complete problem. So there is no polynomial time known solution for this problem.
The solution to this problem can be found by using the following algorithmic approaches – 
1) Brute-force algorithm
2) Dynamic Programming
3) BackTracking
4) Using MST (approximate solution)
5) Christofides (approximate solution)

Our objective here is to analyze and implement the above mentioned algorithmic approaches to this problem and also to analyze their time complexities .
